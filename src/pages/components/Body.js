        <h2>The Traveled Path of The Nimbulan</h2>
        <p>
          All man and beast alike travel this path as they try to get to the
          Lanur Lake in the Maky Mountains. But this path is filled with thives
          and monsters that pray on the weak and the unwary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though is the most traveled road, is the most dangerous. The
          bounty is plenty, the mobs are strong. Many perish in their endevour.
          Take this path and most likely you find your doom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Get the power of lake Lanur and you will have control over land and
          beast.

        <h2>The Untraveld Path of Amu Rin</h2>
        <p>
          This path is one of finding ones inner strenght. Just the wise and the
          enlightened will succeed to go through, as this path is one of knowing
          your self and the world around.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no mobs here, at least not the phisical ones. But the
          spiritual chalanges are as powerfull as the phisical ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you reach lake Lanur through this path, you power and knowledge can
          save or destroy all around you.
